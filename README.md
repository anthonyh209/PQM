# PQD

*Prediction of Quality Data*  is a project which investigates the feasibility of predicting quality ratings of wine samples using different ML regression models.  

For more details and an introduction into the inner workings of the models, please refer to the included report.

## Highlights

- Investigation of 4 different prediction models: pure linear regression, polynomial basis functions, radial basis functions and kNN
- Application of Scikit-learn library and own written functions which mimick functionalities of Scikit for more detailed comparison


## Installation

Installing Scikit-Learn

```
 $ pip install -U scikit-learn
```

or

```
 $ conda install scikit-learn
```

For more detailed instructions, check out the [Installation guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

## Running the script

The main application can be started from the main_source.py script which links to the different models. The Scikit-learn application is optional. Investigations showed that manual implementation of the regression models slightly differ to Scikit provided models.
